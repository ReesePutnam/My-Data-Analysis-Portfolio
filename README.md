# My-Data-Analysis-Portfolio
Displayed here will be the most previous projects I have worked on since completing data analytics certificates.


Sustainability in Fashion was the first project for me to complete with the skills I learned from the Google Data Analytcis certificate and the Google Business Intelligence certifcate.

The data we are using is the sustainable fashion trends data set were found for free on Kaggle. This data set has 5000 rows and 15 columns showing various insights on brands and their usuage of resources to create their clothing. We will use this data set to see which country's have the most sustainable brands and what resources they use to create their clothing that contributes to their sustainability.
